# Ensure merge driver 'ours' is defined by configuring in repo or user git config:
#   git config merge.ours.driver true
# (Git's built-in 'ours' strategy works when invoked via -s ours for a whole merge, but for a path-specific
#  merge driver we map to a no-op driver. If not configured, this entry will be ignored; alternatively,
#  we can simply rely on the file being removed so future merges skip it.)
# Prevent merge conflicts on PR-specific files
