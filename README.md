# Trend Model Project

This repository contains experiments and utilities for analyzing volatility-adjusted trend portfolios. The main focus is the Jupyter notebook `Vol_Adj_Trend_Analysis1.3.TrEx.ipynb`, which demonstrates how to load hedge fund data, apply trend-following rules, and export results.

## Running the notebook

1. Install the required Python packages. The analysis relies on pandas, numpy, xlsxwriter, and ipywidgets.
2. Launch JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```
3. Open `Vol_Adj_Trend_Analysis1.3.TrEx.ipynb` and execute the cells in order.

The notebook generates an output Excel file showing in-sample and out-of-sample statistics for the selected funds.
