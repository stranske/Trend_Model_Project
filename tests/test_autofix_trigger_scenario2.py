"""Intentional lint / style issues to exercise autofix pipeline.

This file deliberately violates formatting (spacing, line length), naming,
and ruff rules (unused imports, unused variables, ambiguous variable names)
so the reusable autofix workflow can demonstrate:
  * black reformatting
  * ruff --fix cleaning imports & variables
  * remaining_issues count after fixes

Safe to keep; assertions ensure test still passes post-fix.
