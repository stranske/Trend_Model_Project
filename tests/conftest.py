"""Pytest configuration.

This project historically relied on callers configuring ``PYTHONPATH`` so that
the ``src`` directory is importable.  Some environments (notably minimal CI
containers) invoke ``pytest`` without performing an editable install which
results in ``ModuleNotFoundError`` during collection.  To keep the tests
importâ€‘safe we ensure the repository's ``src`` directory is on ``sys.path``
before any tests run.

The file also documents a quirk with dependencies like NumPy attempting to set
``PYTHONHASHSEED`` during test execution.  This has no effect because the
environment variable must be specified before the Python interpreter starts. To
reproduce hash behaviour set ``PYTHONHASHSEED=0`` in the environment prior to
running ``pytest``.
