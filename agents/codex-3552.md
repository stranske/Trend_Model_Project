<!-- bootstrap for codex on issue #3552 -->

#### Scope
Add test coverage for any program functionality with test coverage under 95% or for essential program functionality that does not currently have test coverage

#### Tasks
- [ ] Run soft coverage and prepare a list of the files with lowest coverage from least coverage on up for any file with less than 95% test coverage or any file with significant functionality that isn't covered.
- [ ] Increase test coverage incrementally for one set of related issues or 1 file below at a time
