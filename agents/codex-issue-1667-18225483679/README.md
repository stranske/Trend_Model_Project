# Codex Package: Issue #1667 (Run 18225483679)

This folder captures the full bootstrap payload for Issue [#1667](https://github.com/stranske/Trend_Model_Project/issues/1667). It consolidates the reference material that was generated for the Codex automation run with identifier **18225483679** so it can live alongside the source tree.

## Contents
- `issue-summary.md` – canonical copy of the problem statement, goals, and acceptance criteria.
- `implementation-plan.md` – actionable guidance distilled from the bootstrap comments, including workflow touch points and configuration considerations.
- `testing-plan.md` – smoke tests, regression coverage, and manual validation steps required before enabling automerge for minor documentation changes.
- `binary-assets/` – base64 representations of the fonts that were previously attached as binary blobs, plus licensing notes and extraction instructions.

Keeping this package in-repo ensures that future maintainers can reconstruct the bootstrap context even after the short-lived `agents/codex-issue-*` branch is deleted by the cleanup workflows.
