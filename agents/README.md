# Agents instruction index

The files in this directory house the active Codex/agent guidance tied to in-flight issues. Historical bootstraps that referenced retired workflows now live in `../archives/agents/`.

Use the following canonical sources when adding or updating instructions:
- `.github/workflows/README.md` — current workflow inventory and naming rules.
- `docs/ci/AGENTS_POLICY.md` — protection contract and verification steps for the agents workflows.

If an issue-specific instruction file no longer matches the live workflow names or policy versions, move it to `archives/agents/` with a date prefix and note the replacement source.
