# Keepalive status index

To avoid PR conflicts between concurrent keepalive runs, place each run's checklist in its own file under `docs/keepalive/status/`.

Active/most recent entries:
- Diagnostics scope: [docs/keepalive/status/diagnostics.md](docs/keepalive/status/diagnostics.md)

Add new bullet points here only to register additional keepalive runs; do not reuse or overwrite existing status files.
