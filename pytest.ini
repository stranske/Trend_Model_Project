    integration: marks integration tests that exercise external tooling
    quarantine(reason): known failing or flaky; excluded from required checks
    runtime: critical pipeline or engine behaviour; failures block merges and automation will alert humans
    cosmetic: formatting/reporting-only checks eligible for automated remediation
    serial: tests requiring sequential (non-parallel) execution; runs in dedicated xdist worker group
