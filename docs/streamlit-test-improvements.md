# Streamlit Test Infrastructure Improvements

## Issue Resolution: Hardcoded Sleep in Smoke Tests

### Problem
The original PR #619 included a hardcoded 5-second sleep in the Streamlit smoke test (`time.sleep(5)`), which could cause flaky tests and poor developer experience.

### Solution
Implemented a sophisticated readiness check system in `tests/smoke/test_app_launch.py` that:

1. **Configurable Timeouts**: Uses environment variables to control timing
   - `STREAMLIT_STARTUP_TIMEOUT` (default: 30s)
   - `STREAMLIT_POLL_INTERVAL` (default: 0.5s) 
   - `STREAMLIT_READY_TIMEOUT` (default: 5s)

2. **Intelligent Polling**: Instead of hardcoded sleep, polls the HTTP endpoint
   - Retries with configurable intervals
   - Validates HTTP status and response content
   - Times out gracefully with detailed error messages

3. **Health Endpoint Validation**: Checks that the app is actually serving content
   - Validates HTTP 200 status
   - Ensures response contains expected content
   - Handles connection failures during startup

### Usage

```python
# Basic usage (uses environment variable defaults)
result = wait_for_streamlit_ready(port=8765)

# Custom configuration  
result = wait_for_streamlit_ready(
    port=8765,
    timeout=60,           # Wait up to 60 seconds
    poll_interval=0.2,    # Check every 200ms
    ready_timeout=3       # 3 second HTTP timeout
)
```

### Environment Configuration

```bash
# For faster development testing
export STREAMLIT_STARTUP_TIMEOUT=10
export STREAMLIT_POLL_INTERVAL=0.1

# For CI environments with slow startup
export STREAMLIT_STARTUP_TIMEOUT=60
export STREAMLIT_POLL_INTERVAL=1.0
```

### Benefits

- **No more flaky tests**: Eliminates race conditions from fixed delays
- **Faster test execution**: Proceeds immediately when app is ready
- **Better error diagnostics**: Clear messages when startup fails
- **Configurable for different environments**: Fast for dev, robust for CI
- **Backwards compatible**: Same test API, improved implementation

### Testing

Added regression test `tests/test_no_hardcoded_sleeps.py` that:
- Scans for hardcoded sleep patterns
- Validates configuration options exist
- Ensures sophisticated readiness check features are present

This ensures future changes don't reintroduce the hardcoded sleep anti-pattern.
