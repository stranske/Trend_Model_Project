# Turnover Cap Rebalancing Strategy

## Overview

The Turnover Cap Rebalancing Strategy is a portfolio rebalancing mechanism that limits the total amount of portfolio turnover (buying and selling) that can occur in a single rebalancing period. This helps control transaction costs and prevents excessive trading while still allowing portfolio optimization.

## Key Features

### 1. Turnover Enforcement
- **Max Turnover Limit**: Configurable maximum percentage of portfolio that can be traded per period
- **Strict Compliance**: Never exceeds the specified turnover cap, even if full rebalancing is desired
- **Portfolio Under-investment**: Accepts portfolio under-investment when turnover limits prevent full rebalancing (realistic cash management)

### 2. Transaction Cost Modeling  
- **Basis Points Calculation**: Applies configurable transaction costs (e.g., 25 basis points = 0.25%)
- **Applied on Actual Turnover**: Costs calculated only on trades that are actually executed, not desired trades
- **Per-Rebalance Application**: Costs applied once per rebalancing period

### 3. Trade Prioritization Mechanisms
- **`largest_gap`**: Prioritizes trades by absolute size (largest position changes first)
- **`best_score_delta`**: Prioritizes trades by score-weighted benefit (higher-scored assets prioritized)
- **Automatic Fallback**: Falls back to `largest_gap` when scores are unavailable

### 4. Multi-Period Integration
- **Seamless Integration**: Plugs into the `run_schedule()` function in the multi-period engine
- **Period-by-Period Application**: Applied consistently across multiple rebalancing periods
- **Cost Accumulation**: Total transaction costs tracked across all periods

## Usage

### Basic Configuration

```python
from trend_analysis.rebalancing import TurnoverCapStrategy

# Create strategy instance
strategy = TurnoverCapStrategy({
    "max_turnover": 0.15,           # 15% maximum turnover per period
    "cost_bps": 25,                 # 25 basis points transaction cost
    "priority": "best_score_delta"  # Prioritize by score-weighted benefit
})

# Apply to portfolio rebalancing
new_weights, transaction_cost = strategy.apply(
    current_weights=current_portfolio,
    target_weights=target_portfolio,
    scores=asset_scores  # Optional, for best_score_delta priority
)
```

### Multi-Period Engine Integration

```python
from trend_analysis.multi_period.engine import run_schedule

# Configure rebalancing strategies
rebalance_strategies = ["turnover_cap"]
rebalance_params = {
    "turnover_cap": {
        "max_turnover": 0.20,        # 20% max turnover per period
        "cost_bps": 30,              # 30 bps transaction costs  
        "priority": "largest_gap"    # Priority mechanism
    }
}

# Run multi-period backtest with turnover cap
portfolio = run_schedule(
    score_frames,
    selector,
    weighting,
    rebalance_strategies=rebalance_strategies,
    rebalance_params=rebalance_params
)

# Access results
print(f"Total transaction costs: {portfolio.total_rebalance_costs:.4f}")
```

## Configuration Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Default |
|-----------|------|-------------|---------|
| `max_turnover` | float | Maximum portfolio turnover per period (0.0 to 1.0) | 0.2 (20%) |
| `cost_bps` | int | Transaction cost in basis points (1 bp = 0.01%) | 10 |
| `priority` | str | Trade prioritization: "largest_gap" or "best_score_delta" | "largest_gap" |

## Priority Mechanisms

### Largest Gap Priority (`"largest_gap"`)
- **Logic**: Prioritizes trades by absolute size of the position change
- **Best For**: When you want to execute the most significant rebalancing moves first
- **Requirement**: Only needs current and target weights

### Best Score Delta Priority (`"best_score_delta"`)
- **Logic**: Prioritizes trades by score-weighted benefit (increasing high-scored assets, decreasing low-scored assets)
- **Best For**: When you have asset quality scores and want to prioritize moves toward higher-quality assets
- **Requirement**: Requires asset scores to be provided

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Turnover Cap Prevents Full Rebalancing

```
Current:  [40%, 30%, 30%] across [FUND_A, FUND_B, FUND_C]  
Target:   [10%, 10%, 80%] across [FUND_A, FUND_B, FUND_C]
Desired:  60% total turnover (exceeds 15% cap)

Result:   [40%, 30%, 45%] with 15% actual turnover  
Cost:     15% × 25bp = 3.75bp = $3.75 per $10,000
```

### Scenario 2: Priority-Based Trade Selection

With multiple desired trades and limited turnover budget:
- **largest_gap**: Execute biggest position changes first
- **best_score_delta**: Execute trades toward highest-scored assets first

## Technical Implementation

### Core Algorithm
1. **Alignment**: Align current and target weight indices
2. **Trade Calculation**: Compute desired trades = target - current
3. **Turnover Check**: If total desired turnover ≤ cap, execute all trades
4. **Priority Sorting**: Otherwise, sort trades by configured priority mechanism
5. **Budget Allocation**: Allocate turnover budget sequentially by priority
6. **Partial Execution**: Execute partial trades when budget is exhausted
7. **Cost Application**: Apply transaction costs to actual turnover

### Portfolio Under-Investment
When turnover limits prevent full rebalancing, the strategy accepts portfolio under-investment rather than violating the turnover constraint. This reflects realistic cash management where not all desired trades can be executed within cost/turnover constraints.

## Testing and Validation

### Unit Tests
- **12 comprehensive unit tests** covering all functionality
- **Edge cases**: Zero turnover, mismatched asset universes, partial trades
- **Priority mechanisms**: Both largest_gap and best_score_delta
- **Cost calculations**: Various basis point scenarios

### Integration Tests  
- **Multi-period engine integration** with realistic score frames
- **Multiple strategy combinations** 
- **Backward compatibility** with existing codebase

### Demonstration Script
Run the complete demonstration:
```bash
cd /path/to/Trend_Model_Project
source .venv/bin/activate  # if using virtual environment
PYTHONPATH=./src python demo_turnover_cap.py
```

## Performance Characteristics
