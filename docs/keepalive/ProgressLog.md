# Keepalive Progress Log — PR #3573

## Scope
Add test coverage for any program functionality with test coverage under 95% or for essential program functionality that does not currently have test coverage.

## Current Status
- The initial soft coverage sweep has **not** been run yet.
- No individual program files have received additional tests during this round.
- Acceptance criteria remain unmet because no files have exceeded the 95% coverage threshold.

## Next Steps
1. Run the soft coverage report to identify the lowest-coverage files below the 95% target.
2. Increase coverage incrementally, focusing on one file or related cluster at a time until each reaches the threshold.
3. Re-evaluate acceptance criteria after each set of changes and update the checklist when milestones are achieved.
