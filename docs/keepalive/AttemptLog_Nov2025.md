# Keepalive Recovery Attempt Log — November 2025

| Step | Timestamp (UTC) | Action | Result | Evidence |
| ---- | ---------------- | ------ | ------ | -------- |
| 1 | 2025-11-08 | Logged the CI harness patch that introduced `updateComment` support so keepalive post-work tests stop failing. | Positive — eliminated the TypeError that previously broke CI, confirming fixture parity. | `docs/keepalive/PR3337_CI_test_fix_2025-11-08.md`. |
| 2 | 2025-11-09 01:15 | Listed `docs/keepalive/` contents to ensure all canonical references were available before resuming triage. | Neutral — no behavioural change; established the working set for the investigation. | `ls docs/keepalive` (Terminal). |
| 3 | 2025-11-09 01:20 | Re-read `docs/keepalive/GoalsAndPlumbing.md` and `docs/keepalive/Agents.md` to restate contract guardrails and automation expectations. | Neutral — refreshed requirements without altering workflow behaviour. | Local file review. |
| 4 | 2025-11-09 01:27 | Opened `docs/keepalive/PR3337_keepalive_evaluation.md` to compare past successful remediation steps. | Diagnostic — highlighted the persistent Octokit dispatch failure and missing label checks. | Local file review. |
| 5 | 2025-11-09 01:35 | Queried orchestrator run `19156998987` (success case) for job metadata. | Diagnostic — confirmed the run sequence and isolated the keepalive sweep job for deeper log review. | `gh run view 19156998987 --json jobs`. |
| 6 | 2025-11-09 01:37 | Downloaded the keepalive sweep log from job `54759658383` within run `19156998987`. | Negative — reproduced the `github.getOctokit is not available…` failure, proving the root issue persists. | `gh run view 19156998987 --log --job 54759658383`. |
| 7 | 2025-11-09 01:45 | Attempted to inspect Gate run `19216307354` job `54795903248` to analyse the cancellation root cause. | Inconclusive — log already purged (HTTP 404), so no additional evidence recovered. | `gh run view 19216307354 --log --job 54795903248`. |
| 8 | 2025-11-09 01:46 | Queried run `19216307354` for job listings to confirm log availability status. | Inconclusive — API returned an empty job list, confirming the artefacts were gone. | `gh run view 19216307354 --json jobs`. |
| 9 | 2025-11-09 01:50 | Enumerated historical Gate runs to check for systemic cancellations affecting other branches. | Informational — showed only legacy failures; no current systemic outage detected. | `gh run list --workflow gate.yml --json databaseId,headBranch,headSha,conclusion,status,createdAt`. |
| 10 | 2025-11-09 01:51 | Re-ran the Gate listing for `codex/keepalive-restated-autopatch` to confirm no hidden reruns existed. | Neutral — returned empty results, indicating no additional Gate attempts on the branch. | `gh run list --workflow gate.yml --branch chore/demo-pipeline --limit 5 --json ...` (empty). |
| 11 | 2025-11-09 02:05 | Retrieved PR #3423 Gate status roll-up to inspect the python 3.11/3.12 reruns. | Positive — verified both python jobs succeeded on the latest run, clearing the immediate blocker. | `gh pr view 3423 --json statusCheckRollup`. |
| 12 | 2025-11-09 02:06 | Captured PR #3423 comment history to correlate keepalive reactions with the green Gate results. | Neutral — confirmed automation resumed once CI passed, no further change. | `gh pr view 3423 --comments`. |
| 13 | 2025-11-09 02:12 | Gathered PR #3425 Gate status roll-up to study docs fast-pass behaviour. | Informational — confirmed Gate intentionally skipped python jobs, emphasizing coverage safeguards. | `gh pr view 3425 --json statusCheckRollup`. |
| 14 | 2025-11-09 02:13 | Captured PR #3425 comment history to observe manual restatement auto-patching. | Neutral — showed connector converting restatements into rounds, but root Octokit issue unresolved. | `gh pr view 3425 --comments`. |
| 15 | 2025-11-10 00:10 | Queried orchestrator run `19156998987` again to reconfirm sweep job failure while drafting plan updates. | Diagnostic — reinforced that Octokit dispatch remains the primary blocker. | `gh run view 19156998987 --log --job 54759658383`. |
| 16 | 2025-11-10 00:20 | Created this attempt log to capture the full troubleshooting chronology for reference. | Documentation — no behavioural impact, but ensures shared context. | `docs/keepalive/AttemptLog_Nov2025.md`. |
| 17 | 2025-11-10 00:35 | Drafted and agreed on the focused recovery plan: restore Octokit dispatch, enforce workflow token wiring, add Node/py tests, dry-run orchestrator, and monitor production rerun. | Planning — establishes the concrete remediation path that should resolve missed keepalive rounds. | Latest change-plan summary (chat + this log). |
| 18 | 2025-11-10 00:55 | Implemented Octokit fallback in `scripts/keepalive-runner.js`, exported helpers for testing, added Node unit tests, and expanded keepalive workflow fixtures + Python integration tests (including missing-token guard). Ran `./scripts/dev_check.sh --changed --fix` to validate. | Positive — local validation passes; harness test confirms keepalive fails fast when dispatch token absent, eliminating silent Octokit gaps. | Git diff, `.github/scripts/__tests__/keepalive-runner-dispatch.test.js`, `tests/test_keepalive_workflow.py::test_keepalive_requires_dispatch_token`, `./scripts/dev_check.sh --changed --fix`. |
