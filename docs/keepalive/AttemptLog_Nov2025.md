# Keepalive Recovery Attempt Log — November 2025

| Step | Timestamp (UTC) | Action | Result | Evidence |
| ---- | ---------------- | ------ | ------ | -------- |
| 1 | 2025-11-08 | Logged the CI harness patch that introduced `updateComment` support so keepalive post-work tests stop failing. | Positive — eliminated the TypeError that previously broke CI, confirming fixture parity. | `docs/keepalive/PR3337_CI_test_fix_2025-11-08.md`. |
| 2 | 2025-11-09 01:15 | Listed `docs/keepalive/` contents to ensure all canonical references were available before resuming triage. | Neutral — no behavioural change; established the working set for the investigation. | `ls docs/keepalive` (Terminal). |
| 3 | 2025-11-09 01:20 | Re-read `docs/keepalive/GoalsAndPlumbing.md` and `docs/keepalive/Agents.md` to restate contract guardrails and automation expectations. | Neutral — refreshed requirements without altering workflow behaviour. | Local file review. |
| 4 | 2025-11-09 01:27 | Opened `docs/keepalive/PR3337_keepalive_evaluation.md` to compare past successful remediation steps. | Diagnostic — highlighted the persistent Octokit dispatch failure and missing label checks. | Local file review. |
| 5 | 2025-11-09 01:35 | Queried orchestrator run `19156998987` (success case) for job metadata. | Diagnostic — confirmed the run sequence and isolated the keepalive sweep job for deeper log review. | `gh run view 19156998987 --json jobs`. |
| 6 | 2025-11-09 01:37 | Downloaded the keepalive sweep log from job `54759658383` within run `19156998987`. | Negative — reproduced the `github.getOctokit is not available…` failure, proving the root issue persists. | `gh run view 19156998987 --log --job 54759658383`. |
| 7 | 2025-11-09 01:45 | Attempted to inspect Gate run `19216307354` job `54795903248` to analyse the cancellation root cause. | Inconclusive — log already purged (HTTP 404), so no additional evidence recovered. | `gh run view 19216307354 --log --job 54795903248`. |
| 8 | 2025-11-09 01:46 | Queried run `19216307354` for job listings to confirm log availability status. | Inconclusive — API returned an empty job list, confirming the artefacts were gone. | `gh run view 19216307354 --json jobs`. |
| 9 | 2025-11-09 01:50 | Enumerated historical Gate runs to check for systemic cancellations affecting other branches. | Informational — showed only legacy failures; no current systemic outage detected. | `gh run list --workflow gate.yml --json databaseId,headBranch,headSha,conclusion,status,createdAt`. |
| 10 | 2025-11-09 01:51 | Re-ran the Gate listing for `codex/keepalive-restated-autopatch` to confirm no hidden reruns existed. | Neutral — returned empty results, indicating no additional Gate attempts on the branch. | `gh run list --workflow gate.yml --branch chore/demo-pipeline --limit 5 --json ...` (empty). |
| 11 | 2025-11-09 02:05 | Retrieved PR #3423 Gate status roll-up to inspect the python 3.11/3.12 reruns. | Positive — verified both python jobs succeeded on the latest run, clearing the immediate blocker. | `gh pr view 3423 --json statusCheckRollup`. |
| 12 | 2025-11-09 02:06 | Captured PR #3423 comment history to correlate keepalive reactions with the green Gate results. | Neutral — confirmed automation resumed once CI passed, no further change. | `gh pr view 3423 --comments`. |
| 13 | 2025-11-09 02:12 | Gathered PR #3425 Gate status roll-up to study docs fast-pass behaviour. | Informational — confirmed Gate intentionally skipped python jobs, emphasizing coverage safeguards. | `gh pr view 3425 --json statusCheckRollup`. |
| 14 | 2025-11-09 02:13 | Captured PR #3425 comment history to observe manual restatement auto-patching. | Neutral — showed connector converting restatements into rounds, but root Octokit issue unresolved. | `gh pr view 3425 --comments`. |
| 15 | 2025-11-10 00:10 | Queried orchestrator run `19156998987` again to reconfirm sweep job failure while drafting plan updates. | Diagnostic — reinforced that Octokit dispatch remains the primary blocker. | `gh run view 19156998987 --log --job 54759658383`. |
| 16 | 2025-11-10 00:20 | Created this attempt log to capture the full troubleshooting chronology for reference. | Documentation — no behavioural impact, but ensures shared context. | `docs/keepalive/AttemptLog_Nov2025.md`. |
| 17 | 2025-11-10 00:35 | Drafted and agreed on the focused recovery plan: restore Octokit dispatch, enforce workflow token wiring, add Node/py tests, dry-run orchestrator, and monitor production rerun. | Planning — establishes the concrete remediation path that should resolve missed keepalive rounds. | Latest change-plan summary (chat + this log). |
| 18 | 2025-11-10 00:55 | Implemented Octokit fallback in `scripts/keepalive-runner.js`, exported helpers for testing, added Node unit tests, and expanded keepalive workflow fixtures + Python integration tests (including missing-token guard). Ran `./scripts/dev_check.sh --changed --fix` to validate. | Positive — local validation passes; harness test confirms keepalive fails fast when dispatch token absent, eliminating silent Octokit gaps. | Git diff, `.github/scripts/__tests__/keepalive-runner-dispatch.test.js`, `tests/test_keepalive_workflow.py::test_keepalive_requires_dispatch_token`, `./scripts/dev_check.sh --changed --fix`. |
| 19 | 2025-11-10 01:18 | Fired `gh workflow run agents-70-orchestrator.yml` against `codex/keepalive-orchestrator-hotfix` with `options_json` forcing `keepalive_pr=3427`, `keepalive_trace=cli-dry-run`, `dry_run=true`. | Negative — GitHub API returned `403 Resource not accessible by integration`, so the manual dispatch never started. Need repository admin to grant the token workflow-dispatch scope or run via Actions UI. | Terminal output, `gh workflow run … --ref codex/keepalive-orchestrator-hotfix`. |
| 20 | 2025-11-10 01:29 | Updated `idle-precheck` so a manual dispatch that supplies `pr_number` automatically flags keepalive, preventing future runs from idling when no agent issues are open. | Positive — users only need the PR field in the Actions UI; keepalive now triggers even if `options_json` stays `{}`. | `.github/workflows/agents-70-orchestrator.yml`, git diff. |
| 21 | 2025-11-10 02:32 | Investigated workflow-dispatch failure — GitHub flagged “workflow file issue” before any jobs ran. Root cause: duplicate `id: render_instruction` steps inside keepalive job. Renamed summary step to `render_instruction_summary` and updated references so the workflow parses again. | Positive — Workflow compiler now sees unique step IDs, letting dispatch reach `idle-precheck`. | `.github/workflows/agents-70-orchestrator.yml`, `gh run list`, git diff. |
| 22 | 2025-11-10 03:05 | Refactored the keepalive-instruction job to eliminate duplicate gate/token steps, generate the instruction body once, fail fast when comment creation returns no ID, and expose the agent alias/author outputs for downstream jobs. Added a summary preview and verified quick validation. | Positive — Workflow structure no longer triggers “workflow file issue”; downstream consumers get consistent outputs. | `.github/workflows/agents-70-orchestrator.yml`, `./scripts/dev_check.sh --changed --fix`. |
| 23 | 2025-11-10 03:40 | Added a dry-run branch-sync validation job that dispatches `agents-keepalive-branch-sync.yml` with the keepalive trace metadata, polls for completion, records head advancement, and surfaces the outcome in the orchestrator summary. | Positive — Dry-run passes now automatically exercise the staging branch-sync path and capture the run link for follow-up. | `.github/workflows/agents-70-orchestrator.yml`. |
| 24 | 2025-11-10 06:33 | Launched **Keepalive Branch Sync** via Actions UI for PR #3427 with trace `dryrun-20251110-branch-sync` (base `phase-2-dev`, head `codex/keepalive-orchestrator-hotfix`, SHA `9755b3f984f9…`). | Positive — Workflow completed, fetch/merge succeeded, and no sync PR was required because the branches already matched. | [`gh run view 19222868072`](https://github.com/stranske/Trend_Model_Project/actions/runs/19222868072). |
| 25 | 2025-11-10 14:52 | Enumerated cancelled Gate runs on `codex/issue-3428` to quantify branch-sync churn during Round 24. | Diagnostic — surfaced nine cancellations spanning SHAs `2fd99ffd…` through `f58fc2ea…`, confirming update-branch fallback never succeeded. | `gh run list --branch codex/issue-3428 --status cancelled --json databaseId,workflowName,createdAt,headSha`. |
| 26 | 2025-11-10 15:30 | Captured the latest scheduled orchestrator runs to assess run-cap enforcement. | Diagnostic — 12 runs fired within ten minutes (`19235652928` → `19236890071`), evidencing missing rate controls. | `gh run list --workflow "Agents 70 Orchestrator" --json databaseId,createdAt,updatedAt --limit 20`. |
| 27 | 2025-11-10 15:35 | Exported the most recent 100 PR timeline events for #3429 and parsed keepalive rounds/label churn. | Positive — timeline dump confirmed the `agents:keepalive` gap (07:07Z–13:34Z) and 24 instruction rounds with trace IDs for checklist mapping. | `curl https://api.github.com/repos/stranske/Trend_Model_Project/issues/3429/timeline > tmp_logs/pr3429_timeline.json` + local Python parsing. |
| 28 | 2025-11-10 15:45 | Reviewed Keepalive Branch Sync failure (`19222734980`) logs to identify why update-branch never fires. | Diagnostic — step “Prepare sync branch” runs `git fetch origin phase-2-dev --depth=0`, which dies with `fatal: depth 0 is not a positive number`, so the merge step never executes. | `gh run view 19222734980 --log --job 54943673614`. |
| 29 | 2025-11-10 15:58 | Patched `agents-keepalive-branch-sync.yml` to drop the invalid `--depth=0` fetch and rerun the workflow for a dry-run trace. | Mixed — workflow updated to `git fetch --no-tags --prune origin "$BASE_REF"`, but manual dispatch via `gh workflow run …` still fails with 403 (“Resource not accessible by integration”); requires Actions UI run or elevated token. | `.github/workflows/agents-keepalive-branch-sync.yml`, `gh workflow run agents-keepalive-branch-sync.yml …`. |
| 30 | 2025-11-10 17:10 | Reviewed maintainer-dispatched **Keepalive Branch Sync** run `19239811962` (trace `dryrun-20251110-fetchfi`) after the fetch fix. | Positive — job `Prepare sync branch` succeeded, `phase-2-dev` fetched without depth errors, and the workflow exited cleanly with `SYNC_EMPTY=true`, validating the empty-merge path. | `gh run view 19239811962 --log --job 54999370240`. |
| 31 | 2025-11-10 17:45 | Tuned run-cap enforcement to consider recently completed orchestrator/worker runs (≤5 min lookback) alongside in-flight jobs; exposed diagnostics via `active_runs_inflight` / `active_runs_recent` outputs and added Node unit tests. | Positive — local unit tests confirm the throttle treats sequential runs as active when they land inside the window; pending production confirmation. | `.github/scripts/keepalive_gate.js`, `.github/scripts/__tests__/keepalive-gate.test.js`, `node --test .github/scripts/__tests__/keepalive-gate.test.js`. |
| 32 | 2025-11-11 09:20 | Re-read `GoalsAndPlumbing.md` / `SyncChecklist.md`, then evaluated merged PR #3444 against those guardrails. Coverage additions (pipeline, run_analysis, data validation, backtesting harness, signal presets) provide evidence the underlying analytics functions work but do **not** modify keepalive workflows. | Neutral — no progress on guardrail enforcement (Goals §§1–5, §9) or sync fallbacks (Checklist §§1–5); outstanding remediation tasks remain unchanged. | `gh pr view 3444 --json files,commits`, `gh pr diff 3444`, inspection of new tests. |
| 33 | 2025-11-11 16:40 | Pulled Gate run `19248010641` logs (Node TAP + pytest + summary) and Agents PR meta manager run `19248010559` to extract keepalive evidence, then updated `PR3429_keepalive_evaluation.md` with an explicit log-usage plan and revised review procedure referencing those artefacts. | Documentation — established reproducible commands to cite run-cap/label evidence during evaluations. | `gh run view 19248010641 --job 55026665489 --log`, `gh run view 19248010641 --job 55026665495 --log`, `gh run view 19248010641 --job 55026993570 --log`, `gh run view 19248010559 --job 55026653075 --log`, updated markdown diff. |
| 34 | 2025-11-11 03:30 | Dispatched orchestrator against `codex/keepalive-run-cap-notices` with trace `manual-run-cap-20251111` targeting PR #3444 to validate the new notices. Gate halted with `keepalive-label-missing`, and the log exposed `keepalive_run_cap=2`, `active_runs=0`, `active_runs_inflight=0`, `active_runs_recent=0`, `active_runs_recent_window=5`. | Positive — run-cap counters are now visible via CLI logs; guard correctly blocks instruction emission when labels are absent. | `gh run view 19253985636 --job 55044752141 --log`. |
| 35 | 2025-11-11 03:37 | Reran the orchestrator (`run 19254098629`) after restoring `agents:keepalive` and `agent:codex` labels on PR #3444 to confirm the gate proceeds with the new notices. | Negative — gate still returned `keepalive-label-missing`; notices again reported `keepalive_run_cap=2`, `active_runs=0`, `active_runs_inflight=0`, `active_runs_recent=0`, `keepalive_active_runs_recent_window=5`, indicating the labels were missing or not persisted. Requires checking PR label state and workflow label-application permissions. | `gh run view 19254098629 --job 55045145312 --log`. |
| 36 | 2025-11-11 03:44 | Third orchestrator run (`19254213558`) executed immediately after the user re-applied labels; gate still halted with `keepalive-label-missing` and zero utilisation counters even though the CLI reports `agent:codex` present but `agents:keepalive` still absent on PR #3444. | Negative — confirms the guard fails until the `agents:keepalive` label is restored; need to verify why the label toggles are not sticking and whether automation has sufficient permission to add it. | `gh run view 19254213558 --job 55045487335 --log`, `gh pr view 3444 --json labels`. |
| 37 | 2025-11-11 03:49 | Investigated the discrepancy: `gh pr view 3468 --json labels` shows `agents:keepalive` present on the **branch PR** (3468), but the manual orchestrator run still targeted PR **3444** (`KEEPALIVE_PR=3444`). Label history confirms `agents:keepalive` was removed from #3444 at 20:05Z on 2025-11-10 and never re-added. | Diagnostic — explains why the gate keeps failing: the manual sweep is pointing at the wrong PR ID. Next rerun must set `keepalive_pr=3468` (or attach the label back to #3444). | `gh run view 19254213558 --job 55045481030 --log`, `gh api repos/stranske/Trend_Model_Project/issues/3444/timeline --paginate`, `gh pr view 3468 --json labels`. |
| 38 | 2025-11-11 03:51 | Reran orchestrator with `keepalive_pr=3468` (run `19254322103`). Gate proceeded (`keepalive_gate_proceed=true`), counters logged `keepalive_run_cap=2`, `active_runs=0`, `active_runs_inflight=0`, `active_runs_recent=0`, window `5`. Instruction job posted successfully. | Positive — confirms the notices emit on a successful gate when the labelled PR is targeted. Still need evidence of non-zero utilisation to prove the throttle pauses when capacity is hit. | `gh run view 19254322103 --job 55045808500 --log`, `gh run view 19254322103 --job 55045816530 --log`. |
| 39 | 2025-11-11 04:50 | Emergency pause applied to PR #3471 to stop further keepalive rounds while we evaluate run-cap behaviour. Created `agents:pause` label and applied it to PR #3471. | Positive — immediate mitigation: keepalive worker outcomes and orchestrator dispatches now respect `agents:pause` per Goals §4 and will not issue new instructions while present. | `gh label create agents:pause --color ff0000 --description 'Pause keepalive activity (strong halt)'` + `gh pr edit 3471 --add-label agents:pause`. |
| 40 | 2025-11-11 05:15 | Extracted pre-pause orchestrator logs (`19254934411`, `19254946001`, `19255030604`) to capture the run-cap notices for PR #3471. | Diagnostic — all three runs report `keepalive_run_cap=2` but `active_runs`, `active_runs_inflight`, and `active_runs_recent` stay `0` despite landing within five minutes of each other, showing the throttle never engaged before the pause. | `gh run view 19254934411 --job 55047642379 --log`, `gh run view 19254934411 --log \| grep keepalive_run_cap`, `gh run view 19254946001 --log \| grep keepalive_active_runs`, `gh run view 19255030604 --log \| grep keepalive_active_runs_recent`. |
| 41 | 2025-11-11 05:45 | Annotated the orchestrator `run-name` with the targeted PR number and taught `countActiveRuns()` to parse those titles when GitHub omits `pull_requests` metadata; added a regression test covering the fallback. | Positive — future runs expose “Agents 70 Orchestrator (PR #xxxx)” so the counter can recognise default-branch executions, and the Node test suite now guards the behaviour. | `.github/workflows/agents-70-orchestrator.yml`, `.github/scripts/keepalive_gate.js`, `.github/scripts/__tests__/keepalive-gate.test.js`, `node --test .github/scripts/__tests__/keepalive-gate.test.js`. |
