2025-11-08 — CI test harness fix

Summary

- Problem: Several GitHub Actions CI jobs failed due to tests in `tests/test_keepalive_post_work.py`. The Node harness used in those tests called `github.rest.issues.updateComment`, but the harness mock in `tests/fixtures/keepalive_post_work/harness.js` did not implement `updateComment`, so the Node process threw a TypeError and the tests exited with non-zero.

- Fix applied: Added a minimal `updateComment` mock to `tests/fixtures/keepalive_post_work/harness.js` which updates or records the comment body and returns a `{ data: { id, body } }` shape. This prevents the TypeError and allows the harness to exercise the update code path safely.

Actions performed

1. Updated `tests/fixtures/keepalive_post_work/harness.js` to include `updateComment` mock.
2. Ran `pytest -q tests/test_keepalive_post_work.py` locally — all scenarios passed.
3. Committed the change and pushed branch `codex/issue-3333-keepalive-resolver-fix` to origin; PR(s) backed by this branch will receive the update.

Next steps

- Wait for GitHub Actions to re-run on the pushed commits. Monitor the `python ci / python 3.11` and `python 3.12` jobs for green.
- If further failures occur, inspect job logs (check-runs and run artifacts) and iterate on fixes.

Notes

- This change is a test fixture improvement (no production code changed). It is low-risk and intended to unblock CI so we can iterate on the keepalive orchestrator fixes with confidence.
