# Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical documentation that is no longer actively maintained
but is preserved for reference purposes.

## Contents

| Folder | Description | Count |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| `plans/` | Completed implementation plans for closed issues | 39 |
| `ops-issues/` | Operations issue scopes and smoke test artifacts | 5 |
| `audits/` | Point-in-time audit reports | 1 |

## Files

- `ARCHIVE_WORKFLOWS.md` - Retired workflow documentation

## Why Archive?

Documents are archived when:
- They describe **completed implementation work** for closed issues
- They are **dated audit reports** superseded by newer versions
- They reference **retired workflows or features**
- They are **progress logs** for finished tasks

## Active Documentation

Current documentation lives in `docs/` root and subdirectories like:
- `docs/ops/` - Operations playbooks and runbooks
- `docs/phase-1/`, `docs/phase-2/` - Phase-specific design documentation
- `docs/keepalive/` - Keepalive status and monitoring

See `docs/INDEX.md` for the complete documentation map.
