### Step 1: Upload Your Data
- Click the file uploader and select your CSV file
- The first column should be dates, followed by fund return columns
- Data should cover at least 24 months for meaningful analysis

### Step 2: Choose Your Analysis Style
Three preset strategies are available:

- **Conservative**: Low turnover, stable selections
- **Balanced**: Moderate turnover, balanced approach
- **Aggressive**: High turnover, dynamic selections

### Step 3: Run Your Analysis
- Click "Run Analysis" to start the computation
- Progress bars will show the analysis status
- Results appear in real-time as calculations complete

### Step 4: View Your Results
The results dashboard shows:
- **Performance Charts**: Visual performance over time
- **Key Metrics**: Sharpe ratios, returns, volatility measures
- **Fund Rankings**: Which funds were selected and when
- **Risk Analysis**: Drawdowns and risk-adjusted returns

### Step 5: Export Your Results
- Download results as Excel, CSV, or JSON formats
- Export charts as high-resolution images
- Save configurations for future runs

## 📁 Using Your Own Data

### Data Format Requirements
Your CSV file should have:
- **First column**: Dates (YYYY-MM-DD format recommended)
- **Additional columns**: Fund returns in decimal format (0.05 = 5%)
- **Minimum period**: 24 months of data
- **No missing data**: Fill gaps or remove incomplete funds

### Uploading Your Data
1. Prepare your CSV with the format above
2. Use the "Upload" section in the sidebar
3. Map columns if auto-detection fails
4. Verify data preview looks correct
5. Proceed to configuration

### Sample Datasets Included
The app includes demo datasets to get started:
- **Basic Demo**: Simple 8-fund universe
- **Extended Demo**: Larger fund universe with benchmarks
- **Historical Example**: Real market data examples

---

## 💻 Command Line Usage (Advanced)

For users comfortable with the command line:

```bash
# Activate environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run analysis with config
PYTHONPATH="./src" python -m trend_analysis.run_analysis -c config/demo.yml

# Generate demo data
python scripts/generate_demo.py
```

---

## 🔧 Customization

Advanced users can modify:
- **Configuration files** in the `config/` directory
- **Selection strategies** via custom weighting methods
- **Export formats** and output destinations
- **Risk parameters** and volatility targets

---

## ❓ Common Issues & Solutions

### Application Won't Start
**"Connection refused" at http://localhost:8501**
- Wait 60 seconds after running the Docker command
- Check that port 8501 isn't already in use
- Try http://127.0.0.1:8501 instead

**Docker command fails**
- Make sure Docker Desktop is running
- Check your internet connection (needed to download the image)
- Try `docker --version` to confirm Docker is installed

### Data Problems
**Upload fails or gives errors**
- Verify your CSV has a date column as the first column
- Check data covers at least 24 months
- Make sure returns are in decimal format (0.05 = 5%)
- Remove any missing data or text in numeric columns

**Poor analysis results**
- Try different in-sample/out-of-sample time periods
- Increase the minimum track record for funds
- Check if your data period includes unusual market events
- Ensure you have at least 10-15 funds for meaningful selection

### Performance Issues  
**Analysis is slow**
- Reduce the number of funds being analyzed
- Shorten the time period 
- Use simpler presets (Conservative runs faster)
- Close other browser tabs to free up memory
