# health-44-gate-branch-protection Run 18511694775

- **Workflow**: [`health-44-gate-branch-protection`](https://github.com/stranske/Trend_Model_Project/actions/workflows/health-44-gate-branch-protection.yml)
- **Run ID**: [18511694775](https://github.com/stranske/Trend_Model_Project/actions/runs/18511694775)
- **Triggered**: 2025-10-14T22:21:24Z (`workflow_dispatch`)
- **Result**: ✅ Success
- **Key observations**:
  - The job executed the verification step with the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` because no `BRANCH_PROTECTION_TOKEN` secret was configured; the enforcement step was skipped while the verification succeeded.
  - Step logs confirm that branch protection still lists **Gate / gate** as the required context, satisfying the observer-mode verification path added for this issue.
  - The workflow uploaded the `gate-branch-protection-18511694775` artifact containing the JSON snapshots emitted by `tools/enforce_gate_branch_protection.py`.

This run demonstrates Health‑44 reporting OK after the workflow was manually dispatched, meeting the first acceptance criterion for issue #2653.
