1. Agents 70 Orchestrator: confirm and lock in script checkout for local helpers (`.github/scripts/*`)
Labels: agent:codex, agents, devops, guardrail, documentation

Why
Jobs that `require('./.github/scripts/...')` must check out the repo first. The orchestrator currently includes targeted checkouts, but this should be verified and documented so future edits don’t regress and break Resolve/Summary/Scan at runtime.

Scope
Audit the orchestrator and keep a checkout step ahead of every `actions/github-script` call that loads local helpers. Use sparse checkout of `.github/scripts` to keep runs fast. Add a short YAML comment to remind future editors not to delete the checkout.

Non-Goals
Changing orchestrator behavior, schedule, inputs, or belt semantics.

Tasks
- In `.github/workflows/agents-70-orchestrator.yml`, verify checkout exists before each `require('./.github/scripts/...')` usage:
  - `resolve-params` requires `agents_orchestrator_resolve.js`
  - `belt-dispatch-summary` requires `agents_dispatch_summary.js`
  - `belt-scan-ready-prs` requires `agents_belt_scan.js`
- If any job is missing checkout, add:
  - `uses: actions/checkout@v4`
  - `with: sparse-checkout: |` then `.github/scripts` and `sparse-checkout-cone-mode: false`
- Run a `workflow_dispatch` dry run to prove all requires succeed and the job summary renders.
- Add a one-line guard comment near each require: “Do not remove checkout; local helper is required.”

Acceptance criteria
- All jobs that import from `.github/scripts` have a preceding checkout step.
- A manual dry run completes with Resolve/Summary/Scan summaries present and no “Cannot find module” errors.
- The orchestrator file contains brief comments warning against removing the checkout in these jobs.

Implementation notes
File: `.github/workflows/agents-70-orchestrator.yml`
Helpers: `.github/scripts/agents_orchestrator_resolve.js`, `agents_dispatch_summary.js`, `agents_belt_scan.js`

2. Agents 63 Intake: align unlabeled policy with triggers (add `unlabeled` or codify “no‑unlabeled”)
Labels: agent:codex, agents, devops, guardrail, documentation

Why
Intake now fires on `opened/reopened/labeled` with a concurrency group. Decide whether removing an `agent:*` label should trigger Intake too. Either add `unlabeled` to `on: issues` or explicitly document that unlabeled events are out of scope.

Scope
Pick one policy:
- Support unlabeled: add `unlabeled` to `on: issues.types`, ensuring the normalization guard and concurrency still avoid double-processing.
- Or explicitly do not support unlabeled: keep triggers as-is and add a short doc note clarifying behavior so folks don’t expect it.

Non-Goals
Changing bridge wiring, parser behavior, or intake field names.

Tasks
- Review `.github/workflows/agents-63-issue-intake.yml` `on: issues.types` to determine if `unlabeled` is present; confirm that the triggers match the intended policy (either include `unlabeled` or document its absence).
- If adopting unlabeled: include `- unlabeled` under `issues.types` and confirm the `normalize_inputs` guard condition still gates on presence of `agent:*` labels to avoid no-op runs.
- If not adopting unlabeled: add a 1–2 line note to `docs/ci/AGENTS_POLICY.md` clarifying that Intake does not react to unlabeled events.
- Validate with a sandbox issue: add/remove `agent:codex` and confirm either single-run (with unlabeled) or no run (without unlabeled), with concurrency preventing duplicates.

Acceptance criteria
- Triggers and policy are consistent: either unlabeled is supported and safe, or it’s explicitly documented as out of scope.
- Label add/remove behavior matches the chosen policy in a live test, with no duplicate intake runs.

Implementation notes
