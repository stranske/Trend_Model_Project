1) Title: Make autofix workflow fork-safe without ACTIONS_BOT_PAT
Labels: bug, ci, github-actions, priority: medium, risk:medium
Body:
## Why
The autofix loop exits early on forked pull requests because it hard-requires the ACTIONS_BOT_PAT secret before running, so contributors cannot receive patch artifacts or cosmetic fixes when repository secrets are unavailable.
## Scope
- Introduce a fallback path that uses GITHUB_TOKEN-only permissions for forked PRs and produces patch artifacts instead of pushing branches when a PAT is missing.
- Preserve the current PAT-powered branch push/comment flow for trusted contexts where secrets are available.
- Ensure autofix status reporting clearly indicates when a fallback mode was used and where maintainers can fetch patches.
## Non-Goals
- Changing formatter/tool versions or adding new linters.
- Altering the max-attempts/keepalive logic that decides whether autofix should run.
## Tasks
- [ ] Detect forked contexts or missing ACTIONS_BOT_PAT and switch to a patch-only mode using GITHUB_TOKEN, skipping branch pushes.
- [ ] Continue using the PAT path (checkout + push) when secrets are present while keeping step conditions mutual and explicit.
- [ ] Emit clear summary/comment text that states whether autofix ran in PAT or fallback mode and links to the produced patch artifact when no push occurs.
- [ ] Add coverage in the workflow tests (or mock runs) to confirm both paths succeed without secret access errors on forks.
## Acceptance Criteria
- Autofix no longer fails on forked PRs due to missing ACTIONS_BOT_PAT and instead provides a downloadable patch artifact.
- PAT-backed runs still push branches and comments as before, with logs showing which path executed.
- Workflow documentation/comments note the fork-safe fallback behaviour for future maintenance.

2) Title: Harden workflow checkouts for forked PR heads
Labels: bug, ci, github-actions, priority: medium, risk:medium
Body:
## Why
Gate and orchestrator jobs that checkout PR head commits can fail for forked contributions when the repository input defaults to the base repo, blocking detection, summary composition, or keepalive orchestration.
## Scope
- Audit workflow jobs that read PR head SHAs (Gate summary helpers, orchestrator workflow_run handlers, belt conveyor/meta workflows) and ensure checkouts target the contributing repository when available.
- Add fallback protections so workflow_run events gracefully handle missing pull_request metadata or inaccessible SHAs instead of aborting.
## Non-Goals
- Modifying job logic unrelated to repository selection or ref resolution.
- Changing concurrency, keepalive, or scheduling policies.
## Tasks
- [ ] Identify every actions/checkout step that pulls a PR head SHA and add repository overrides that prefer `pull_request.head.repo.full_name` (or equivalent) with safe fallbacks to `github.repository`.
- [ ] Update workflow_run handlers to skip or warn when head metadata is absent rather than failing the run, keeping automation resilient across event types.
- [ ] Add lightweight validation (unit tests or dry-run jobs) demonstrating forked PR head checkouts succeed for the audited workflows.
## Acceptance Criteria
- All PR-head checkouts succeed on forked contributions across Gate/orchestrator/meta workflows, with no missing-commit errors.
- workflow_run jobs log warnings instead of failing when head data is unavailable, and default to the base repo safely.
- New coverage confirms fork-aware repository selection is exercised in CI.

3) Title: Reduce Python CI install time with reusable caches
Labels: enhancement, ci, performance, priority: medium, risk:low
Body:
## Why
Python CI jobs reinstall the full toolchain (uv, pytest, formatters) on every matrix run, leading to long runtimes and occasional timeouts on larger PRs despite pip cache toggles.
## Scope
- Leverage uv/pip caching to reuse compiled wheels and virtual environments across matrix entries and reruns.
- Trim redundant installs by reusing shared tool versions (from autofix pins) and avoiding duplicate `pip install` calls where uv sync already resolves dependencies.
## Non-Goals
- Changing test selection, markers, or coverage thresholds.
- Introducing new dependencies beyond cache helpers.
## Tasks
- [ ] Enable uv cache (or actions/cache) for uv's cache directory and wheel artifacts keyed by python version + lockfile, and document the cache keys.
- [ ] Consolidate formatter/test dependency installs to a single install path per run (e.g., rely on uv sync + pinned extras) to eliminate duplicate pip invocations.
- [ ] Add timing notes or a metrics hook to confirm install duration drops after caching.
## Acceptance Criteria
- Python CI jobs reuse cached dependencies across matrix runs, with logs showing cache hits and reduced install time.
- Redundant install steps are removed/merged while still installing pinned tooling from `.github/workflows/autofix-versions.env`.
- CI remains green across reruns with the new cache strategy.
