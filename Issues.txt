1) Docs alignment: WORKFLOW_SYSTEM.md vs AGENTS_POLICY.md

Labels: docs, documentation, workflows, priority: medium, risk:low, status: ready

Why?
  - Summary
    - WORKFLOW_SYSTEM.md says Gate is the only required check; AGENTS_POLICY.md says the default branch requires Gate and Agents Guard. Documentation must be consistent and match enforcement.

Tasks

- Pick the authoritative stance: keep Agents Guard required.

- Update docs/ci/WORKFLOW_SYSTEM.md to state the required checks explicitly and reference the Health 44 enforcement job.

- Cross‑link both docs and note the stable status context strings.

- Add a short “How to verify required checks” section that points to Health 44 snapshots.

Acceptance criteria

- Both docs list the same required checks and link to the enforcement workflow file.

- Merged PR updates any diagrams/topologies to show Agents Guard in the merge gate.


2) Repository ruleset: verify block on deletion/renames of protected agent workflows

Labels: config, devops, workflows, agents, priority: high, risk:low, status: ready

Why?
  - Summary
    - Policy claims a repository ruleset blocks deletion or unsafe edits to the three protected agent workflows (Agents 63 pair + 70 Orchestrator). This is configured outside the repo and needs validation.

Tasks

- Attempt to delete or rename each protected workflow from a test branch and push.

- Expected: push is rejected by the ruleset.

- If the push succeeds, configure a repository ruleset to block file deletions/renames and restrict edits to CODEOWNERS.

- Document the ruleset name and settings in docs/ci/AGENTS_POLICY.md and add a one‑line verification command/UI path.

Acceptance criteria

- Proof of failed push for delete/rename attempts (screenshot or link to failed action).

- Policy doc updated with the ruleset name and a quick verification step.


3) Agents 63 Codex Issue Bridge: consider cancel-in-progress: true for per‑issue concurrency

Labels: agents, ci, devops, workflows, enhancement, priority: low, risk:low, status: ready

Why?
  - Summary
    - agents-63-codex-issue-bridge.yml uses a concurrency group per issue with cancel-in-progress: false. If labels flap, runs queue up.

Tasks

- Inspect the last 7 days of runs for queue depth/backlog per issue.

- If more than one run is often queued for the same concurrency key, flip cancel-in-progress: true.

- Note the trade‑off in the workflow summary for maintainers.

Acceptance criteria

- Either: the flag is turned on and redundant runs are cancelled; or: evidence is attached showing no backlog and the issue is closed as “no change.”


4) Health 44: surface branch‑protection snapshots directly in job summary

Labels: ci, workflows, enhancement, priority: medium, risk:low, status: ready

Why?
  - Summary
    - Health 44 already produces JSON snapshots. Make drift visible without downloading artifacts by echoing a minimal table or JSON excerpt into the job summary.

Tasks

- After snapshot generation, add a step to render a compact list of required checks and branch rule toggles in the step summary.

- Keep full JSON as an artifact for audit.

Acceptance criteria

- The Actions UI shows current required checks and any diffs vs previous run in the summary.

- Artifact still contains the full JSON.
