1. Cosmetic tests fixer: narrow scope to tests/**

Labels: autofix, testing, workflows, priority: low, status: ready, risk:low

Why
Keeping test noise low speeds PR review. A tests-only autofix mode avoids risky edits elsewhere.

Tasks

 Add a label-gated mode autofix:tests that only targets tests/**.

 Apply import reordering, whitespace fixes, and simple ruff fixes.

 Post a brief summary comment.

Acceptance Criteria

A demo PR with autofix:tests only modifies files under tests/**.

Gate remains green after fixes.

Implementation Notes

Reuse steps from the cosmetic autofix workflow, but restrict pathspecs.

2. Post-CI: single source of truth summary with coverage delta

Labels: workflows, ci, tech:coverage, enhancement, priority: medium, status: ready, risk:low

Why
Gate should be lean; Post-CI should aggregate and present the final story for humans.

Tasks

 Ensure Post-CI triggers only for Gate runs tied to PRs.

 Add a small coverage delta section comparing base vs head when artifacts are present.

 Guarantee only one PR comment exists; updates should edit in place.

Acceptance Criteria

Post-CI posts or updates a single comment per PR containing job table and coverage delta.

No duplicate comments on reruns.

Implementation Notes

Use the PR number and head SHA to compute the edit target.

Use a hidden HTML anchor in the comment body to find and update the prior comment.

3. Docs: CI/agents overview and required checks

Labels: documentation, workflows, infra, priority: low, status: ready, risk:low

Why
Future you will forget why this all works. A short map prevents archaeology.

Tasks

 Add docs/ci/WORKFLOW_SYSTEM.md explaining PR Gate, Post-CI, Repo Health, Actionlint, Agents Orchestrator, Agents Guard.

 Document required status checks for merge and optional informational checks.

 Link the doc from .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md.

Acceptance Criteria

New PRs show a link to the doc in the template.

The doc lists each workflow, when it runs, and what blocks merges.

Implementation Notes

Include a tiny “How to re-run only X” section for triage.

4. Maintenance sweep: archive superseded workflows

Labels: workflows, refactor, priority: low, status: ready, risk:low

Why
Reducing file count reduces cognitive load and run noise.

Tasks

 Move superseded workflows to docs/archive/ARCHIVE_WORKFLOWS.md as bullet links with one-line rationale.

 Remove them from .github/workflows/.

 Verify Actions list is free of near-duplicate entries.

Acceptance Criteria

No duplicate entries for selftests or agent guards appear in Actions.

Archive doc exists and lists moved files.

Implementation Notes

Keep commit messages explicit: chore(workflows): archive <name> in favor of <replacement>.
