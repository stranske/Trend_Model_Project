# Retired GitHub workflows

The automation files in this directory previously lived under `.github/workflows/`,
but they have been removed from the Actions roster. They remain here only for
reference so we can see how the agent automations used to work.

- `agents-64-pr-comment-commands.yml`
- `agents-74-pr-body-writer.yml`

If a workflow needs to be resurrected, copy it back under `.github/workflows/`
and update it to match the current automation guardrails before re-enabling it.
