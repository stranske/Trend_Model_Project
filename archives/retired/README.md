# Retired GitHub workflows

These automation files previously lived under `.github/workflows/`, but they have been removed from the Actions roster. They are preserved here so we can reference how the agent automations used to work and what replaced them.

- `agents-64-pr-comment-commands.yml` (superseded by `agents-pr-meta.yml`)
- `agents-74-pr-body-writer.yml` (superseded by `agents-pr-meta.yml`)

If a workflow needs to be resurrected, copy it back under `.github/workflows/` and update it to match the current automation guardrails before re-enabling it.
