# 2025 Notebook Archive

This folder contains earlier iterations of the volatility-adjusted trend analysis notebooks that have been superseded by the maintained `notebooks/Vol_Adj_Trend_Analysis1.5.TrEx.ipynb`.

## Contents
- `Old/`: legacy exploration notebooks plus supporting config/data snapshots from the initial trend analysis development.
- `notebooks_old/`: intermediate clean-up and refactoring variants produced while stabilizing the trend analysis workflow.

## Purpose and inputs
- Focus: manager selection and performance evaluation for trend strategies, experimenting with configuration clean-ups, debugging ordering, and user-selection workflows.
- Data inputs: Trend Universe CSV/Excel files shipped in the repository root; some notebooks also reference helper configs (e.g., `trend_portfolio_config_refactored.yaml`) saved alongside the notebooks.

## Conclusions
These notebooks captured historical experiments and debugging sessions. The insights they generated have been incorporated into the current 1.5 workflow; retain them here for provenance without blocking day-to-day maintenance.
