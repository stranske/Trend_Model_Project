# Archived agent instruction files

Legacy agent guidance that referenced retired workflow names or superseded policy drafts lives here for historical context. Current automation and protection rules are documented in:

- `.github/workflows/README.md` for the active workflow topology and naming policy.
- `docs/ci/AGENTS_POLICY.md` for the protection contract covering the agents workflows.

## Archived on 2025-11-22
- `2025-11-22-codex-2682.md` – instructions focused on removing the old Agents 61/62 consumer workflows, which are no longer present.
- `2025-11-22-codex-2684.md` – bootstrap plan for drafting the original agents policy file that has since been published and maintained elsewhere.
- `2025-11-22-codex-2729.md` – branch-protection checklist tied to the phased Gate/Health 45 setup that has been replaced by the current Gate + Agents Guard enforcement described in the CI docs.
