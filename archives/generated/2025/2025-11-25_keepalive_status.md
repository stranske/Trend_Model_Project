# Keepalive status index

To avoid PR conflicts between concurrent keepalive runs, place each run's checklist in its own file under `docs/keepalive/status/`.

Active/most recent entries:
- PR #3791 (CI caching and install consolidation): [docs/keepalive/status/PR3791_Status.md](docs/keepalive/status/PR3791_Status.md)
- Diagnostics scope: [docs/keepalive/status/diagnostics.md](docs/keepalive/status/diagnostics.md)
- PR #3787 (fork-safe autofix fallback): [docs/keepalive/status/PR3787_Status.md](docs/keepalive/status/PR3787_Status.md)
- PR #3790 (fork-safe head checkout hardening): [docs/keepalive/status/PR3790_Status.md](docs/keepalive/status/PR3790_Status.md)

Add new bullet points here only to register additional keepalive runs; do not reuse or overwrite existing status files.
