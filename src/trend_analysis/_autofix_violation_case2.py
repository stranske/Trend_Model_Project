"""Intentional style violations to force the reusable autofix workflow to act.
This opening docstring is intentionally written as one very long, runâ€‘on
paragraph lacking proper line wrapping or formatting so that ``docformatter``
will reflow it into a canonical width. The goal is to introduce a deterministic
diff ignored by our pre-commit pipeline (which does not invoke docformatter)
while still being caught by the composite autofix action in CI.

Additional context: we also include import ordering / spacing issues that are subtle enough
that isort will act, and we add a secondary, excessively long explanatory paragraph to
reinforce deterministic wrapping behaviour. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
sentence is repeated to inflate length without semantic complexity. The quick brown fox
jumps over the lazy dog; the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog; the quick brown fox
jumps over the lazy dog. End of deliberately verbose section.
