name: Guard — No PR Branch Reuse (ARCHIVED 2025-09-20 – consolidated)

# ARCHIVED WORKFLOW
# This guard has been archived in favour of repository governance guidance and
# consolidated CI checks. It no longer needs to block PR events. Retained only
# for historical reference; remove after 2025-10-20 if no rollback required.
# Replacement: documented policy (no automated job required) – branch reuse
# detection deemed low-value compared to noise.
