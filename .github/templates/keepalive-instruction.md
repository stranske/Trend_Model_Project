Your objective is to satisfy the **Acceptance Criteria** by completing each **Task** within the defined **Scope**.

**This round you MUST:**
1. Implement actual code or test changes that advance at least one incomplete task toward acceptance.
2. Commit meaningful source code (.py, .yml, .js, etc.)—not just status/docs updates.
3. Mark a task checkbox complete ONLY after verifying the implementation works.
4. **POST A REPLY COMMENT** with the updated checklist showing `- [x]` for completed items.

**DO NOT:**
- Commit only status files, markdown summaries, or documentation when tasks require code.
- Re-post checklists without making implementation progress.
- Close the round without source-code changes when acceptance criteria require them.
- Complete work without posting a reply comment showing which checkboxes are now checked.

Review the Scope/Tasks/Acceptance below, identify the next incomplete task that requires code, implement it, then **post a reply comment** with the updated checklist showing your verified progress (change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` for completed items).
