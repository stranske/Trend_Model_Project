# Scripts inventory

This directory hosts the maintained automation and demo helpers. Root-level
Python scripts were reviewed and relocated to reduce clutter; only tests remain
at the repository root.

## Root-level script sweep

| Script | Category | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `generate_extended_demo.py` | Demo data generation | Moved to `scripts/demo/` | No references found in `Makefile`, `docs/`, or `scripts/` via `rg`.
| `demo_malformed_date_fix.py` | One-off fix demo | Archived under `archives/scripts/` | Kept for historical context; no active references found via `rg`.
| `demo_proxy.py` | Debugging demo | Archived under `archives/scripts/` | Streamlit proxy debugging aid; no active references found via `rg`.
| `manager_attribution_analysis.py` | Deprecated wrapper | Archived under `archives/scripts/` | Superseded by `trend` CLI; no active references found via `rg`.
| `test_multi_period_selection.py` | Tests | Left at repo root | Pytest entry point.
| `test_upload_app.py` | Tests | Left at repo root | Pytest entry point.

## Demo data generation

- `scripts/generate_demo.py`
  - Purpose: build a 10-year synthetic return set for ~20 managers plus SPX and a low-volatility RF column.
  - Inputs: none; optional `--no-xlsx` flag to skip Excel output.
  - Outputs: `demo/demo_returns.csv` (always) and `demo/demo_returns.xlsx` (default).
  - Example: `python scripts/generate_demo.py --no-xlsx`
- `scripts/demo/generate_extended_demo.py`
  - Purpose: generate a 20-year extended demo data set with market index noise.
  - Inputs: none; uses deterministic NumPy RNG seed.
  - Outputs: `demo/extended_returns.csv` and `demo/extended_returns.xlsx`.
  - Example: `python scripts/demo/generate_extended_demo.py`

## Demo pipeline runners

- `scripts/run_multi_demo.py`
  - Purpose: exercise the multi-period engine using demo data and
    `config/demo.yml`.
  - Inputs: expects demo returns from the generation step; consumes
    `config/demo.yml` for configuration.
  - Outputs: multi-period score frames and exports under `demo/exports/`
    (CSV/XLSX/JSON/TXT) plus logs.
  - Example: `python scripts/run_multi_demo.py`
- `scripts/run_threshold_churn_demo.py`
  - Purpose: simulate churn rules against the demo returns using Sharpe-based
    entry/exit thresholds.
  - Inputs: demo return series generated by the demo data step.
  - Outputs: churn simulation metrics printed to stdout and saved artifacts
    in the demo export path when enabled.
  - Example: `python scripts/run_threshold_churn_demo.py`

## Analysis and app helpers

- `scripts/run_real_model.py`
  - Purpose: run the full production model against configured data inputs.
  - Inputs: configuration files in `config/` and data under `data/` per your
    environment setup.
  - Outputs: performance artifacts under `perf/` and logs under `logs/`.
  - Example: `python scripts/run_real_model.py --config config/production.yml`
- `scripts/run_streamlit.sh`
  - Purpose: launch the Streamlit UI with the repository's environment setup.
  - Inputs: relies on the installed dependencies and configuration in `config/`.
  - Outputs: serves the Streamlit app locally (default port 8501).
  - Example: `./scripts/run_streamlit.sh`
- `scripts/run_tests.sh`
  - Purpose: convenience wrapper to execute the test suite with the
    repository's preferred options.
  - Inputs: none.
  - Outputs: pytest results (stdout/stderr).
  - Example: `./scripts/run_tests.sh`
