Project Overview and Planning
1. Introduction
Purpose:

Build a multi-phase investment simulation tool to evaluate manager selection strategies across multiple time periods, culminating in a Monte Carlo analysis.

Scope:

Phase 1 (Complete/Initial)

Single in-sample vs. out-of-sample analysis for trend and volatility-adjusted returns.

Identifies managers that meet data requirements, excludes those with insufficient data.

Produces performance and risk metrics (CAGR, Sharpe, drawdowns).

Exports results to Excel.

Phase 2 (Upcoming)

Extends to multi-period (multi-decade) simulations.

Implements various selection/rebalancing strategies (rank-ordered, memory-based threshold, random, manual, etc.).

Stores results in user-chosen formats (Excel, CSV, JSON, SQLite DB).

Adds a “demo/test” mode for quick debugging with fewer periods.

Phase 3 (Future)

Adds Monte Carlo functionality to run multiple simulations.

Evaluates the stability of conclusions under repeated sampling.

Tests parameter effectiveness (e.g., transaction cost assumptions, skill vs. luck, etc.).

Additional Features:

Phase 2b (Low Priority): Consider non-return data factors (AUM, fees, turnover, etc.) for correlation/regression analysis after simulation.

Potential extension to advanced constraints (turnover, capacity) and advanced skill-based analysis (regression tests, randomization checks).

3. Current Status
Phase 1 (Vol_Adj_Trend_Analysis_Cleanup7.ipynb)
Core Logic: Single in-sample vs. out-of-sample.

Uses Rolling Windows: For trend signals, volatility adjustment.

Excludes Managers Without full data in that window.

Performance Metrics: CAGR, Volatility, Sharpe, Drawdowns.

Exports: Currently to Excel (multiple sheets).

Code Review Summary:

Strengths: Readable, modular enough for single-run analysis.

Next Steps: Needs refactoring to accommodate multi-period rebalancing, add new selection strategies, possibly separate out large code blocks into .py modules for maintainability.

4. Planned Improvements (Phase 2)
Multi-Period Simulation

Periodic rebalancing (monthly, quarterly, or annually).

Retain or drop managers based on thresholds.

Integrate a “rank-ordered” approach to automatically pick top managers.

Refactoring

Move core logic (trend calculations, performance metrics, Excel export) into separate Python modules for easier testing.

Possibly unify in-sample/out-of-sample splits into a loop that can handle multiple rebalancing points.

Demo/Test Mode

Toggle that runs a 3–4 period simulation with fewer managers to quickly validate “fired manager” logic and threshold triggers.

Output Options

In addition to Excel, store runs in:

CSV / JSON

SQLite Database (storing each run’s parameters and summary results).

Additional Strategy Selection

Incorporate manual mode, rank-ordered mode, random selection, or “all” managers.

Potential memory-based weighting (increasing/decreasing weight based on manager’s historical performance “memory”).

Future “2b” Add-on (Low Priority)

Potentially run a correlation/regression analysis using manager-level attributes (AUM, fees, turnover) to see how they align with performance changes.

5. Monte Carlo Plans (Phase 3)
Repeat the Multi-Period Simulation many times with randomizations or parameter variations.

Analyze how stable the manager selection outcomes are (skill vs. luck).

Parameter Sensitivity: Evaluate different thresholds, weighting schemes, or selection criteria in repeated runs.

1. Phase 1 Task List
Based on your bullet points, here is the consolidated to-do list for Phase 1:

Refactor Notebook → Modules

Create separate modules for at least:

Data Handling (importing data, filtering managers with incomplete data).

Risk/Return Calculations (CAGR, volatility, drawdowns, Sharpe, etc.).

Modularize Run_analysis

Modularize exports and Add CSV/JSON Exports

In addition to Excel, implement a simple function to save results_df (or a dictionary-based approach) to CSV/JSON.

Keep the notebook as a driver or example usage, but move large function blocks out into .py files.

Parameter Dictionary

Consolidate parameters (like start_date, end_date, lookback_window, etc.) into a single dictionary or config object.

For example:

python
Copy
Edit
config = {
  "start_date": "2000-01-01",
  "end_date": "2020-12-31",
  "lookback_days": 252,
  ...
}
Update the existing code to reference config instead of scattered variables.


Add a rank ordered function and allow selection of that in the UI
In Phase 1, create a basic function that takes the performance metrics and selects top N or top N%.

Even if it’s only applied once (because Phase 1 is single-window), at least the selection logic will be tested.

Add Test Mode

A parameter toggle: demo_mode = True/False.

If demo_mode = True, maybe load fewer managers or fewer dates for a quick run.

Or define a short date range (like 2–3 years) so you can quickly confirm the code runs without a big dataset.

Try/Except Blocks

Consider placing them around:

File I/O: When reading CSV, Excel, etc. (to catch missing files or read errors).

Merges or Joins: If code merges data frames on date/manager, you might want a user-friendly error if columns are missing.

Export Functions: If the user tries to export to a path that doesn’t exist or if there’s a permission issue.

You can keep it minimal—just ensure it produces clear error messages.

Add a toggle for switching between using the volatility adjustment function and not using it. Make sure the toggle is available in the UI after the user load funds
