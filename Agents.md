# Initial Prompt
2a I want to take the next step in the research project. The current program will be used separately whenever we need to evaluate a portfolio over the course of one year. The second phase will focus on the process of simulating selection of a portfolio within an asset class over a multi-decade period of time. The general structure of the program will be to take the current program’s functionality and use it to do the analysis on one period’s portfolio performance. The new program will focus on simulating the process of making decisions about the portfolio each period over a multiple periods and rebalancing the portfolio each period according to a strategy. Let’s discuss the range of strategies to include, but they should be at least the following: maximizing returns, maximizing Sharpe, limiting drawdowns, meeting a portfolio return target given a risk budget and identifying and grouping managers using their past track record for the probability that they will contribute to one of the goals listed above. The new program will retain the mode functionality of being able to simulate “all” (for the effect of getting index like exposure), “random” (for being able to select randomly from among managers who both have data availability and fit within either a rank ordered or percentage of the sample threshold), “manual” (that will involve a human decision maker presented with the in-sample data for a period that’s rank ordered, with filter potential, and have the human select a portfolio and weights each period; out-of-sample returns as well as in-sample returns for the next period would be calculated and stored and the process would iterate through an analysis period) and a new “rank-ordered” category. Let me know if the rank ordered category should be added to the existing program before beginning work on the new one. The rank ordered mode would automatically select the top “n” managers within an in-sample period, or the top “n%” managers according to the selection criteria. There should be two output modes. The first would use the export to excel function to produce a spreadsheet with an in-sample and out-of-sample tab for each period with data for each period over an analysis window. The second would store results for output and we will need to work on what output options are available in addition to excel. The second new functionality for the program will be to take the data from one analysis window and develop multiple manager evaluation approaches from a simulation. We will consider at least tiered and rank ordered output according to a selection criteria that will be similar to the selection criteria used for individual periods. 

Please let me know what questions you have about the design, and suggest any improvements to the design that you think I should consider. The code for the first phase of the process is available at the link

2b It’s a low priority, and I don’t want it to slow code design, but I’d also like to consider a second analysis mode at the end that takes non-return data over a recent historical period (1,3,5 year) for things like AUM or AUM growth, employee turnover, fee-levels, or balance sheet characteristics of the manager and runs a regression model to estimate correlation between change in relative standing in our simulation and factors in the model.

3 The third phase of analysis will involve turning the simulation developed in phase two of the program and adding Monte Carlo functionality. There will be two purposes and two modes for analysis. One mode will seek to evaluate the effects of multiple runs of the simulation on conclusions from the analysis. The second will attempt to evaluate model parameters to determine whether any of them provide useful information about the costs/benefits of adopting certain parameters during the analysis.

For 2b and 3, I don’t want to work on code design yet. But I’m introducing them now so that in case we need to consider any features in 2a to be ready for the latter phases, we can discuss that now.

The code for phase 1 of the process, which will form the core of the next phase, is available here. 

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stranske/Trend_Model_Project/refs/heads/main/Vol_Adj_Trend_Analysis_Cleanup.ipynb

Let's begin with any questions you have about the design and suggestions that you have. I want to focus on any elements of the design that may introduce noise or make a user more likely to form conclusions about an investment based on its historical performance that have little value for considering future performance.

Project Overview and Planning
1. Introduction
Purpose:

Build a multi-phase investment simulation tool to evaluate manager selection strategies across multiple time periods, culminating in a Monte Carlo analysis.

Scope:

Phase 1 (Complete/Initial)

Single in-sample vs. out-of-sample analysis for trend and volatility-adjusted returns.

Identifies managers that meet data requirements, excludes those with insufficient data.

Produces performance and risk metrics (CAGR, Sharpe, drawdowns).

Exports results to Excel.

Phase 2 (Upcoming)

Extends to multi-period (multi-decade) simulations.

Implements various selection/rebalancing strategies (rank-ordered, memory-based threshold, random, manual, etc.).

Stores results in user-chosen formats (Excel, CSV, JSON, SQLite DB).

Adds a “demo/test” mode for quick debugging with fewer periods.

Phase 3 (Future)

Adds Monte Carlo functionality to run multiple simulations.

Evaluates the stability of conclusions under repeated sampling.

Tests parameter effectiveness (e.g., transaction cost assumptions, skill vs. luck, etc.).

Additional Features:

Phase 2b (Low Priority): Consider non-return data factors (AUM, fees, turnover, etc.) for correlation/regression analysis after simulation.

Potential extension to advanced constraints (turnover, capacity) and advanced skill-based analysis (regression tests, randomization checks).

| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Use a local DB (SQLite) alongside Excel/CSV/JSON**                  | **Yes**          | Helps store multiple simulation runs, track parameters, and retrieve data easily for Phase 3 Monte Carlo. |
| **Include rank-ordered mode**                                         | **Yes**          | Top N or top N% managers, optionally weighting by rank.                                                   |
| **Implement threshold-based removal (“memory” approach)**             | **Yes**          | E.g., if manager’s performance is X stdev below for Z periods or hits a drawdown threshold, remove.       |
| **Maintain a “demo/test” mode**                                       | **Yes**          | Quickly runs \~3-4 periods to test manager entry/exit logic and debugging.                                |
| **Manual selection mode**                                             | **Yes**          | The user can manually pick managers in-sample, see out-of-sample returns.                                 |
| **Store parameters and metadata with each run**                       | **Yes**          | So we can replicate and compare runs (dates, selection strategy, thresholds, etc.).                       |
| **Multi-factor selection** (combining alpha, drawdowns, fees, etc.)   | **Yes** (future) | The code should be structured to allow multiple weighting or rank metrics easily.                         |
| **Partial returns** (allow managers with incomplete data in a period) | **No**           | For now, exclude managers unless they have full data for the relevant in-sample and out-of-sample window. |
| **Real-time dashboard**                                               | **No**           | Not needed; we’ll rely on storing results for offline analysis and visualizations.                        |
| **Including advanced constraints** (turnover, capacity, etc.)         | **No** for now   | We’ll skip friction and capacity constraints until we see the need.                                       |
| **Statistical significance tests in core code** (t-tests, Bayesian)   | **Maybe Later**  | Possibly in a later phase (or done externally) once the program outputs are available.                    |
| **Transaction costs** in multi-period logic                           | **Maybe Later**  | Could add them once the basic multi-period framework is stable.                                           |
| **Bootstrapping / Randomization** to test skill vs. luck              | **Maybe Later**  | Part of the advanced validation (Phase 3 or beyond).                                                      |
| **Database schema** (tables for runs, manager-level data, etc.)       | **To decide**    | Will finalize in Phase 2 once we define exactly how to store simulation outputs.                          |

3. Current Status
Phase 1 (Vol_Adj_Trend_Analysis_Cleanup7.ipynb)
Core Logic: Single in-sample vs. out-of-sample.

Uses Rolling Windows: For trend signals, volatility adjustment.

Excludes Managers Without full data in that window.

Performance Metrics: CAGR, Volatility, Sharpe, Drawdowns.

Exports: Currently to Excel (multiple sheets).

Code Review Summary:

Strengths: Readable, modular enough for single-run analysis.

Next Steps: Needs refactoring to accommodate multi-period rebalancing, add new selection strategies, possibly separate out large code blocks into .py modules for maintainability.

4. Planned Improvements (Phase 2)
Multi-Period Simulation

Periodic rebalancing (monthly, quarterly, or annually).

Retain or drop managers based on thresholds.

Integrate a “rank-ordered” approach to automatically pick top managers.

Refactoring

Move core logic (trend calculations, performance metrics, Excel export) into separate Python modules for easier testing.

Possibly unify in-sample/out-of-sample splits into a loop that can handle multiple rebalancing points.

Demo/Test Mode

Toggle that runs a 3–4 period simulation with fewer managers to quickly validate “fired manager” logic and threshold triggers.

Output Options

In addition to Excel, store runs in:

CSV / JSON

SQLite Database (storing each run’s parameters and summary results).

Additional Strategy Selection

Incorporate manual mode, rank-ordered mode, random selection, or “all” managers.

Potential memory-based weighting (increasing/decreasing weight based on manager’s historical performance “memory”).

Future “2b” Add-on (Low Priority)

Potentially run a correlation/regression analysis using manager-level attributes (AUM, fees, turnover) to see how they align with performance changes.

5. Monte Carlo Plans (Phase 3)
Repeat the Multi-Period Simulation many times with randomizations or parameter variations.

Analyze how stable the manager selection outcomes are (skill vs. luck).

Parameter Sensitivity: Evaluate different thresholds, weighting schemes, or selection criteria in repeated runs.

# End Task list and priorities

# Start Phase 1 Task List
1. Phase 1 Task List
Based on your bullet points, here is the consolidated to-do list for Phase 1:

Refactor Notebook → Modules

Create separate modules for at least:

Data Handling (importing data, filtering managers with incomplete data).

Risk/Return Calculations (CAGR, volatility, drawdowns, Sharpe, etc.).

Keep the notebook as a driver or example usage, but move large function blocks out into .py files.

Parameter Dictionary

Consolidate parameters (like start_date, end_date, lookback_window, etc.) into a single dictionary or config object.

For example:

python
Copy
Edit
config = {
  "start_date": "2000-01-01",
  "end_date": "2020-12-31",
  "lookback_days": 252,
  ...
}
Update the existing code to reference config instead of scattered variables.

Modularize Risk/Return Metrics

Move existing calculations (e.g., drawdowns, Sharpe) into a dedicated module, e.g., metrics.py.

Keep them self-contained (each metric is a function) so Phase 2 can call them easily.

results_df or results_dict

Pick one approach for storing single-run outputs.

A DataFrame is typical if you want to do further analysis quickly in pandas.

A dict can be better if you have multiple data structures (like per-manager returns, summary stats, etc.).

The key is consistency: ensure the final “result” of a run is in one place. You’ll add to it (or override it) for Phase 2’s multi-period approach.

Add CSV/JSON Exports

In addition to Excel, implement a simple function to save results_df (or a dictionary-based approach) to CSV/JSON.

Example:

python
Copy
Edit
results_df.to_csv("results.csv", index=False)
Or for JSON:

python
Copy
Edit
results_df.to_json("results.json", orient="records")
Add Rank-Ordered Mode

In Phase 1, create a basic function that takes the performance metrics and selects top N or top N%.

Even if it’s only applied once (because Phase 1 is single-window), at least the selection logic will be tested.

Add Test Mode

A parameter toggle: demo_mode = True/False.

If demo_mode = True, maybe load fewer managers or fewer dates for a quick run.

Or define a short date range (like 2–3 years) so you can quickly confirm the code runs without a big dataset.

Try/Except Blocks

Consider placing them around:

File I/O: When reading CSV, Excel, etc. (to catch missing files or read errors).

Merges or Joins: If code merges data frames on date/manager, you might want a user-friendly error if columns are missing.

Export Functions: If the user tries to export to a path that doesn’t exist or if there’s a permission issue.

You can keep it minimal—just ensure it produces clear error messages.
# End Phase 1 Task List

#Phase 2 Draft Outline
1. Data Frequency Detection
Purpose: Automatically identify whether the dataset is daily, monthly, or quarterly.

Implementation:

Examine the date column, look at the average or median gap between observations for each manager (or overall).

Decide on a threshold (e.g., if the median gap is 25–35 days, call it “monthly”; if 1 day, “daily”).

If detection fails or is ambiguous, we can fall back to a user-defined parameter in the config.

> Config Parameter: auto_detect_frequency = True/False.

If True, run frequency detection logic.

If False, rely on a user-provided frequency field in the config.

2. Rolling Window + Start/End Dates
Date Handling

We will still allow the user to define an overall start_date and end_date for the entire analysis range.

Within that range, the code will slice data to the relevant subset.

Multi-Period Logic

For each rebalancing point, define an in-sample window length (e.g., 18 months) and an out-of-sample window length (e.g., 6 months).

Move the window forward by the out-of-sample duration (or the rebalancing frequency) to create the next period.

> Config Parameters:

analysis_start_date, analysis_end_date

in_sample_length (e.g., 18 months, 252 trading days, etc.)

out_of_sample_length (e.g., 6 months, 126 trading days, etc.)

Note: If the user is analyzing from 2000-01 to 2020-12, the code ensures we don’t step beyond 2020-12 in the final out-of-sample period.

3. Manager Availability
Dropping Managers

If a manager doesn’t exist for the in-sample window (due to starting late or going out of business), exclude them automatically.

Infer existence from missing data. If the manager’s return series is missing for that window, they’re not considered.

Memory / Threshold Logic

If a manager was previously selected, do we keep them unless they cross a performance threshold?

Or do we “re-pick” from scratch each time? This will be configurable.

4. Database Schema
Runs Table (runs)

Columns: run_id, timestamp, parameters_json, plus any high-level notes.

Results Table (results)

Columns: run_id, manager_id, period_start, period_end, weight, return, volatility, etc.

Implementation

Use SQLite.

Insert one record per run into runs and multiple records (one per manager per period) into results.

5. Caching & Performance
Caching Rolling Stats

If we recalc rolling windows for each sub-period, performance might suffer. We can store rolling volatility, average returns, etc. in a dictionary keyed by (manager_id, start_date, end_date).

Profiling

Perform a quick profile if the data set or number of runs grows large.

6. Volatility Adjustment Toggle
Two Return Calculation Options

Volatility-Adjusted (as in Phase 1) — e.g., weighting or normalizing returns by their in-sample volatility.

Raw Returns — no volatility adjustments.

Implementation

A config parameter, e.g., volatility_adjusted = True/False.

If True, the code uses the existing logic from Phase 1 to scale positions or returns by volatility. If False, it calculates returns without scaling.

7. Full Phase 2 Workflow Summary
Below is the full multi-period process, integrating all the updates:

Load & Preprocess Data

Slice by analysis_start_date and analysis_end_date.

If auto_detect_frequency = True, detect frequency.

Define Rebalancing Periods

Convert in_sample_length and out_of_sample_length to the detected frequency (e.g., 18 months = 18 “month-steps” for monthly data).

Determine rebalancing checkpoints from start to end of the dataset.

For Each Rebalancing Window

In-Sample: [t - in_sample_length, t)

Filter managers who have data in that window.

Compute metrics (returns, vol, drawdowns, etc.) – possibly use caching if repeated calculations.

If volatility_adjusted=True, adjust or normalize returns.

Select Managers

Rank-Ordered / Random / Memory Threshold.

If memory logic is used, keep managers from prior period unless they fail the threshold.

Otherwise, pick from scratch.

Out-of-Sample: [t, t + out_of_sample_length)

Evaluate the chosen managers’ performance.

Save results (manager ID, OOS returns, etc.) in a DataFrame or dict.

Move to Next Rebalancing Point.

Compile Results

Once all periods are done, combine into a final results_df.

Write to Excel/CSV/JSON and also insert into SQLite DB if configured.

If the user wants a “demo/test mode,” do fewer rebalancing points or fewer managers.
